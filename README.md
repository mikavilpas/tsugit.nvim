# âš¡ A blazingly fast [lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit) + Neovim integration

Lazygit is a powerful terminal UI for git. This is a Neovim plugin I built for
myself to make it even more powerful.

## âœ¨ Features

- **Blazingly fast**: No more waiting for lazygit to start up. After starting it
  once, it's always running in the background.
  - Restart lazygit with `q`. It's automatically restarted in the background
    when you quit it.
  - Alternatively, toggle lazygit on/off. Instantly bring it back with the same
    key.
- **Seamless integration**: Use lazygit as if it's a part of Neovim. No extra
  applications are required.
  - You can edit files in Neovim while lazygit is open.
  - yeah, that's it for now ðŸ˜„

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

Requires [lazy.nvim](https://lazy.folke.io/).

```lua
---@module "lazy"
---@type LazySpec
return {
  "mikavilpas/tsugit.nvim",
  keys = {
    {
      "<right>",
      function()
        require("tsugit").toggle()
      end,
      { silent = true, desc = "toggle lazygit" },
    },
    {
      "<leader>gl",
      function()
        local absolutePath = vim.api.nvim_buf_get_name(0)
        require("tsugit").toggle_for_file(absolutePath)
      end,
      { silent = true, desc = "lazygit file commits" },
    },
  },
  -- NOTE: opts is required in lazy.nvim so that setup() is called
  ---@type tsugit.UserConfig
  opts = {
    -- The key mappings that are active when lazygit is open. They are
    -- completely unusable by lazygit, so set the to rare keys.
    keys = {
      toggle = "<right>",
    }
  },
}

```
